## Why GitHub Pages Might Show 404 Errors

GitHub Pages deployments can take 5-10 minutes to complete after a repository is first set up. If you're seeing 404 errors, the deployment might still be in progress.

## Direct HTML View

You can also view the HTML version by viewing the raw content of the index.html file:
1. Go to the [index.html file](https://github.com/Brunai2013/home-automation-comparison/blob/main/index.html)
2. Click the "Raw" button at the top of the file
